                        <p>Vatsalya Trust, Mumbai was registered as a Public Charitable Trust on 08.02.1983 under Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950. The main objective of our Trust is to take care of the destitute of all ages with special emphasis on children.  Moreover, for the past few years, we have been also actively working on providing:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Shelter and education to girls, who are socially-economically deprived,</li>
                            <li>Home to senior citizens, </li>
                            <li>Empowerment of women/youth through skill development programmes  </li>
                            <li>Health care and guidance to children ( Khushi / Aakar) </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Under Empowerment of Women programme, Trust initiated a number of short- term courses which would generate employment. These included Tailoring, Beautician, Artificial jewellery making, leather goods making, Bakery, Painting and Montessori Teacher's Training. All the above courses were conducted on a token fee and as a result, more than 400 girls coming from lowest strata of society could get training and employment. 
                            </p>
                        <p>In the year 2005, we devised with the assistance and guidance of doctors / nursing tutors one year course (Patient Assistant Course) for girls who secured marginal marks in Higher Secondary School Examination and could not therefore secure admission to colleges and/or for those girls whose parents could not afford to spend for further education of their girls because of poverty. Initially we, on our own, conducted three batches of girl students who immediately secured jobs in famous Hospitals. The students were trained in basic Anatomy by Doctors / Nursing Tutors for about 4/5 months followed by intensive practical training in Hospitals. The Open University, Maharashtra located at Nashik took cognizance of the fact that the girls, after this training, get good jobs took initiative to introduce a similar course under their aegis and our Trust then became a centre of that University for Patient Assistant Course. Our Trust has so far trained 750 girls under this course and practically all of them have secured jobs in big Hospitals / Nursing Homes in and around Mumbai.</p>
                        <p>One more notable feature, of the course is that in each batch we take about 10 to 15 girls from tribal areas of Maharashtra. These areas are not easily accessible and they are starved of basic medical facilities. The entire expenses of these girls on account of stay, food, clothing, education, medical assistance are being met by our Trust. In turn, we persuade them to go back to their rural villages/area after they complete their training and serve the local people.  These girls can easily find job in local Public Health Centres (PHC) and thus can spread health and hygiene awareness among those remote regions. We have so far trained more than 70 girls from tribal/ rural areas.

                        </p>
                        <h5><b>Patient  Assistant Programme - Skill Development to Self-Reliance</b></h5>
                        <p>On conducting a study of a large number of girls who secured marginal marks in Secondary/ Higher Secondary School Examination, it was observed that many could not secure admission in colleges or Training Institutes and thus could not pursue their further education.  Abject Poverty also leads to same fate for many girls.</p>
                        <p>These young women are also at a greater disadvantage due to lack of awareness, skills, family and social pressures restricting their mobility and access to education facilities and livelihood opportunities thereby making them most vulnerable.</p>
                        <p>Genesis of ‘Patient Assistant Programme’ lies in above woes of women.  This programme aims at empowering women by imparting employable skills to them so that they can live life of dignity, self respect and independence.</p>

                        <h5><b>Introduction of “Patient Assistant Programme”</b></h5>
                        <p>Economic empowerment of women is one of the most crucial factors contributing to not just the development of individuals, but also of families, communities, and of the nation as a whole.</p>
                        <p>The Patient Assistant Programme aims at providing skill-based vocational training to women from the disadvantaged backgrounds & generates employment opportunities amongst them. </p>

                        <h5><b>Brief Description of “Patient Assistant Programme”</b></h5>
                        <p>Patient Assistant Programme is the skill development initiative taken by Vatsalya Trust, Mumbai in association with RPG Foundation to empower girls / women in the age group of 16-35 residing in Central / Western Suburbs of Mumbai and Maharashtra region.</p>
                        <p>One of the notable features of the programme is that in each batch we train about 10 to 15 girls from tribal regions of Maharashtra. These areas are not easily accessible and they are starved of basic medical facilities. On completion of training these girls go back to their villages/tribal belt and serve the local people.  These girls can easily find job in local Public Health Centres (PHC) and thus can spread health and hygiene awareness among those remote regions. </p>
                        <p><b>This year (2014-15) we have a target to train and employ 55 girls under Patient Assistant Programme.</b></p>
                         
                        <h5><b>Implementing agent - Management of project</b></h5>

                        <h5><b>Project review / Evaluation and sustainability of Project:</b></h5>
                        <p>Social & economic empowerment of adolescents & young women from disadvantaged communities in the age group of 16-35 years is achieved by providing them combination of <b>life skills, literacy, & vocational skills training</b>.  It enables them to take up wage or self employment and become a contributing member to society.</p>
