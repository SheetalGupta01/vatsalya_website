					<h4><b>Introduction :</b></h4>
					<p>Our Trust decided to start an Orphanage for destitute / deserted children, mostly infants as a first activity and after obtaining the licence from the Government the same was inaugurated on 02-06-1985.  The Trust, in the last 28 years or so gave shelter to 1230 children. Sometimes, we have to accept a child within hours of delivery from Maternity Homes. We also accept children abandoned in a public place, like say Temple / Garbage Bins / Rly. Platform ; These are of course brought to us by Police Department.</p>

					<p>We maintain these children in our premises only ; and for that purpose, have provided the entire paraphernalia – say – a Pediatrician (incidentally he happens to be our President, as well ) a Matron, Nurses, Ayahs etc. Various equipments have been installed for treatment of the children and in case of emergency, a private Hospital is in the vicinity only at a walking distance.</p>

					<p>Once a child under our care is declared medically fit, we try to find adoptive parents for the same. We strongly believe that these children should be brought up in our cultural background and we therefore do not give them in adoption to a foreigner. We try to find our own adoptive parents, may be even NRIs because they are our people. Secondly we give these children in adoption under Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act only. Only those children who have severe medical problems are being given in adoption to foreigners. So far there are only 9 cases of the category.</p>

				<p><h5><b>From 02-06-1985 to 31-03-2013, 1035 children has been adopted. </h5></b>Initially we used to give them anywhere in our country, right from Chandigarh to Chennai and from Ahmedabad to Kolkatta. However, we have to restrict to our areas only because of the restrictions placed by the Government on all institutions in the city for giving children in adoption outside their area of operations.</p>
