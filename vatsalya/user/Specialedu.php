                        <h5><b>Qualification :</b></h5>
                        <p>Special educators are the professionals who are completed D.Ed./B.Ed./M.Ed.from University in Special education. 
                            Special Education can be provided to the child as: 
                           <li>a one to one setting outside or within his/her formal educational environment. </li>
                            <li>a Pull-out service where special remedial, therapeutic, or enrichment services can be provided to students outside the regular classroom which is referred to as Pull-out services.

                            <p>An Inclusive Model of education would imply educational provision for individuals with special needs within the educational system where these children study side by side with their mainstream peers, so as to enable them to develop to their full potential. Inclusion is an educational philosophy aimed at "normalizing" special services for which students qualify. </p>
                            <p>Inclusion involves an attempt to provide more of these special services by providing additional aids and support inside the regular classroom, rather than by pulling students out for isolated instruction. Inclusion involves the extension of general education curriculum and goals to students receiving special services. It involves shared responsibility, problem solving, and mutual support among all the staff members who provide services to students. 
                                One aim of inclusion is to reduce the removal of students from the regular classroom when the same intent of service can be provided within the regular classroom.
