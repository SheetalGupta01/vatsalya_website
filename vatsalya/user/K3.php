					<h4><b>Introduction :</b></h4>
					
					<p>In 2003, our building at Kanjur Marg started functioning.  We initiated a number of short- term projects which would generate employment. These included Tailoring, Beautician, artificial jewellery making, leather goods making, Bakery, Painting and Montessori Teacher's Training. All the above courses were conducted on a token fee; <u>as a result, more than 400 girls coming from lowest strata of society could take advantage there of</u>.</p>

                    <p>In the year 2005, we devised with the assistance and guidance of doctors / nursing tutors <b>one year course (Patient Assistant Course) for girls </b>who secured marginal marks in Secondary School Examination and could not therefore secure admission to college or those girls whose parents could not afford to spend for further education of their girls because of poverty. Initially we, on our own, conducted three batches of girl students who immediately secured jobs in famous Hospitals. The students were trained in Anatomy by Doctors / Nursing Tutors for about 4/5 months followed by intensive practical training in Hospitals. The open University, Maharashtra located at Nashik took cognizance of the fact that the girls, after this training, get good jobs took initiative to introduce a similar course under their aiges and our Trust then became a centre of that University for Patient Assistant Course. Our Trust has<b> so far trained 550 girls for this course and practically all of them secured jobs in big Hospitals / Nursing Homes in and around Mumbai.</b></p>

                <p>The average expenses of this course are about Rs. 15,000/- p.a. per girl. However in view of the fact that most of the girls hail from economically and academically backward class, we charged only Rs. 6,000/- for each girl. The deficit, we collect from public donations.<p>

                    <p>One more notable feature, of the course is that in each batch we take about 10 girls from tribal areas of Maharashtra. These areas are not easily accessible and they are starved of basic medical facilities. The entire expenses of these girls on account of stay, food, clothing, education, medical assistance are being met by our Trust. In turn, we persuade them to go back to their rural villages to serve local people. We have so far trained 61 girls from these tribal areas.</p>

					<h4><b>Introduction :</b></h4>
                    <p>One more project we started in the year 2006 was <b>Computer Training Centre. </b>In the present age computer proficiency is a must for securing any job. But the fees charged by private coaching classes are horrible and are beyond the reach of a common man. We therefore inaugurated this Centre just to serve a common man and we charge a nominal fee of Rs. 500/- for the entire course which covers MS-Office, DTP, Tally, Internet etc. The response from the general public is very encouraging and so far <u> 545 students have completed the above course.</u></p>
