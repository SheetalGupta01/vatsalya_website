						Intervention at around 1st year of life. They deals with speech and language development with the help of audio visual aids.

						</p>
						<h5><b>Visiting the Speech Therapist</b></h5>
						<p>
						Research highlights the importance of early intervention, very often the Speech and Language Therapist will be involved with early intervention. This will sometimes involve direct work with your child and at timed will involve working with you on strategies to support his/her communication. 
						</p>
						<p>Approaches, which may be introduced to this age group, may include:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS)</li>
						<li>Non-directive Language Therapy (Special Times)</li>
						<li>Early group work</li>
						<li>Introduction of the TEACCH approach</li>
						<li>Structured language programmes</li>
						<li>Increasing predictability</li>
						<li>Emerging literacy</li>
						<li>Ways to Enrich Language</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
						<b>Play Activities</b> - Some play activities lend themselves to enhanced language interactions. Games, dramatic play, block play, songs, and stories can all be focal points- with the adult being the catalyst for productive communication.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b>Self-care Activities</b> - Waiting in line to use the sink or bathroom is a perfect opportunity to enrich language. Tell stories, make up rhyming words, sing the alphabet song while you wait, count fingers, toes, or the number of children, and talk about colors. 
						</p>
						<p>
						<b>Eating Activities</b> - So much conversation can happen around an eating activity. Sitting around a table with other children as an adult peels an orange, cuts an apple, or divides portions can be powerful language stimuli. Conversation about sizes, shapes, colors, favorite foods-any number of topics are natural topics of conversation.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b>Classroom Activities</b> - Reading books, acting out familiar stories, making rhymes, singing songs, having children make up stories and "write" books are not new activities, but they certainly promote language and speech.
						</p>
						
						<h5><b>Qualification</b></h5>
						<p>A speech and language therapist is a trained person who works with a child to improve her speech and language skills. Sometimes speech therapists work to improve other oral (mouth) problems, such as eating or drinking difficulties. </p>
